## 📁 Current Structure

### Backend Character Model Fields:
```python
class Character(models.Model):
    # Basic Information
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100, unique=True)
    form = models.CharField(max_length=100, blank=True)
    description = models.TextField(blank=True)
    saga = models.CharField(max_length=100, blank=True)
    role = models.CharField(max_length=50, blank=True)
    race = models.CharField(max_length=50, blank=True)
    
    # Stats
    level = models.IntegerField(default=1)
    attack = models.IntegerField(default=0)
    defense = models.IntegerField(default=0)
    health = models.IntegerField(default=100)
    
    # Moves and Abilities
    special_move = models.CharField(max_length=100, blank=True)
    ultimate_move = models.CharField(max_length=100, blank=True)
    strengths = models.TextField(blank=True)
    weaknesses = models.TextField(blank=True)
    
    # Images
    profile_image = models.ImageField(upload_to='characters/profile/')
    full_body_image = models.ImageField(upload_to='characters/full_body/')
```

### Image Storage Structure:
```
backend/media/characters/
├── profile/          # Character profile images
└── full_body/        # Character full body images
```

## 🎯 Character Names in Database:
1. `Goku` (Base Form)
2. `Goku Super Saiyan`
3. `Goku Black Rose`
4. `Goku Ultra Instinct`
5. `Vegeta Ultra Ego`
6. `Piccolo Orange`
7. `Frieza Black`
8. `Gohan Beast`
9. `Cell Max`
10. `Kid Buu`
11. `Kid Gohan`

## 🚀 How to Add Character Images

### Method 1: Django Admin Interface
1. **Start Django Server:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

2. **Access Admin:**
   - Go to: `http://localhost:8000/admin/`
   - Navigate to `Characters` → `Characters`
   - Click on any character to edit

3. **Upload Images:**
   - Scroll to the "Images" section
   - Upload `Profile Image` (portrait for character selection)
   - Upload `Full Body Image` (full artwork for detailed views)
   - Save the character

### Method 2: Direct File Upload
- Place images in the appropriate folders:
  - Profile images: `backend/media/characters/profile/`
  - Full body images: `backend/media/characters/full_body/`
- Update character records through Django admin

## 🔧 API Endpoints

### Character Endpoints:
- `GET /api/characters/characters/` - List all characters
- `GET /api/characters/characters/{id}/` - Get specific character
- `GET /api/characters/characters/stats/` - Get character statistics

### Response Format:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Goku",
  "form": "Base",
  "description": "The legendary Saiyan warrior...",
  "saga": "Multiple",
  "role": "Hero",
  "race": "Saiyan",
  "level": 85,
  "attack": 82,
  "defense": 78,
  "health": 100,
  "special_move": "Kamehameha",
  "ultimate_move": "Spirit Bomb",
  "strengths": "Endurance, Adaptability, Pure Heart",
  "weaknesses": "Overconfidence, Naivety",
  "profile_image_url": "/media/characters/profile/goku_profile.jpg",
  "full_body_image_url": "/media/characters/full_body/goku_fullbody.png",
  "is_available": true
}
```

## 🎮 Frontend Integration

### RTK Query Usage:
```javascript
// In components
const { data: characters, isLoading, error } = useGetCharactersQuery({
  saga: 'Super Hero',
  role: 'Hero'
})

// Character images are automatically available
characters?.map(character => (
  <CharacterImage 
    character={character} 
    type="profile" 
    className="w-32 h-40" 
  />
))
```

### Component Updates:
- `CharacterImage` now accepts `character` object instead of `characterName`
- Images are fetched directly from character data via RTK Query
- No need for separate image API calls
- Automatic image URL resolution

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### 1. **Test Backend API:**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/characters/characters/"
```

### 2. **Test Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
# Visit: http://localhost:5173/characters
```

### 3. **Test Image Upload:**
1. Go to Django admin
2. Edit a character
3. Upload profile and full body images
4. Verify images appear in frontend

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Upload Character Images:**
   - Add profile images for homepage character showcase
   - Add full body images for team section and detailed views
   - Use Django admin interface for easy management

2. **Test Frontend Integration:**
   - Verify characters load from backend API
   - Check that images display correctly
   - Test character filtering and search

3. **Add More Characters:**
   - Use Django admin to add new characters
   - Follow the established field structure
   - Upload appropriate images for each character

## 🎯 Benefits of This Approach

- **Centralized Management**: All character data managed through Django admin
- **Image Upload**: Direct image upload without external URLs
- **API Integration**: Seamless RTK Query integration with frontend
- **Scalable**: Easy to add new characters and fields
- **Maintainable**: Single source of truth for character data
- **User-Friendly**: Django admin provides intuitive interface for non-technical users

The character model is now fully integrated with image upload capabilities and connected to the frontend via RTK Query!
